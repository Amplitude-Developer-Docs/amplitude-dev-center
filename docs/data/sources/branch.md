With it, you can share all user data in real-time and allow non-technical product and marketing team members to measure the value of your marketing channels and product features to identify sources with the best user retention and engagement.

    This Branch integration uses the [Amplitude Attribution API](../../analytics/apis/attribution-api.md) to send data to Amplitude. Make sure you understand how the Attribution API works before setting up this integration.
