## Authorization

The Profile API supports API key authentication that uses your secret key by setting an Authorization header. Note that this is different than most of the Amplitude APIs, because it uses your secret key only.

"Authorization": "Api-Key SECRET_KEY "

See [Find your Amplitude Project API Credentials](../find-api-credentials.md) for help locating your credentials.
