!!!info "This integration is maintained by 1Flow"

    This integration is maintained by 1Flow. Contact the [1Flow support team](https://1flow.app/) with any questions about this integration.

[1Flow](https://1flow.app/) enables product-led customer everboarding through embedded onboarding checklists, contextual guides, and empty states. Our powerful data model allows guides to be customized per customer via attributes or even human tailoring. Customers are able to get set up at their own speed, track progress, and collaborate across their team. 
With the Bento ingestion integration, you can send events to Amplitude to understand the impact of engagement with guides on user activation.

## Considerations

- This integration is only available for customers who have paid plans with both 1Flow and Amplitude.
- You must enable this integration for each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- To use this integration, you must have an Amplitude User ID that maps to a 1Flow user profile. 1Flow supports the User ID field, and you should make sure to use the same User IDs across 1Flow and Amplitude.
