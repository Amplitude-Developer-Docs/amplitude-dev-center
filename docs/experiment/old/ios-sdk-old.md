Client-side iOS Experiment SDK implementation reference.

!!!info "SDK Resources"

    - [iOS SDK Reference :material-book:](https://amplitude.github.io/experiment-node-server/)
    - [iOS SDK Repository :material-github:](https://github.com/amplitude/experiment-node-server)
    - [iOS SDK Releases :material-code-tags-check:](https://github.com/amplitude/experiment-node-server/releases)

## Installation

The iOS SDK can be installed through CocoaPods or the Swift Package Manager

### CocoaPods

- Add the following to yourÂ `Podfile`

```bash
pod 'AmplitudeExperiment', '~> 1.3.0'
```

### Swift Package Manager

1. Navigate to File -> Swift Package Manager -> Add Package Dependency.
2. EnterÂ `<https://github.com/amplitude/experiment-ios-client>`Â when choosing the package repo. It will automatically resolve it and locate the latest version. After successfully being added, it will show up as a dependency.

## Quick Start

1. [Get your deployment's API key](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/deployments)
2. [Configure and initialize the experiment client](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#initialization)
3. [Fetch variants for a user](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#fetch-variants-for-a-user)
4. [Lookup a flag's variant](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#lookup-a-variant)

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  // (1) Get your deployment's API key
  let apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"

  // (2) Configure and initialize the experiment client
  let config = ExperimentConfig()
  let client = Experiment.initialize(apiKey: apiKey, config: config)

  // (3) Fetch variants for a user
  let user = ExperimentUser.Builder()
    .userId("user@company.com")
    .deviceId("abcezas123")
    .userProperty("premium", value: true)
    .build()
  client.fetch(user: user) { client, error in
    // (4) Lookup a flag's variant
    let variant = client.variant("YOUR-FLAG-KEY")
    if (variant.value == "on") {
      // Flag is on
    } else {
      // Flag is off
    }
  }
  return true
}
```

## Initialization

In the entry point to your application (e.g.Â `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`), initialize theÂ `ExperimentClient`Â with your API Key and a configuration. You can find the API Key in theÂ [Deployments](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/deployments)Â section of your Experiment project.

```swift
// Intialize client with apiKey and config
let apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"
let config = ExperimentConfig()
let client = Experiment.initialize(apiKey: apiKey, config: config)
```

> ### ðŸ“˜
>
> Singleton Instance
>
> `Experiment.initialize`Â returns a default singleton instance backed by user defaults. It is recommended that you either (a) inject the initialized instance throughout your application or (b) wrap the initializedÂ `ExperimentClient`Â in your own API. Ultimately, subsequent calls toÂ `initialize`Â will return the initial instance regardless of input.

###

Configuration

[](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#configuration)

TheÂ `ExperimentClient`Â can be configured on initialization. Once initialized, the client's configuration cannot be changed. Initialize an emptyÂ `ExperimentConfig`Â for the default configuration, or use theÂ `ExperimentConfig.Builder`Â to build aÂ [custom configuration](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/configuration#client-side).


```swift
let defaultConfig = ExperimentConfig()
let customConfig = ExperimentConfig().Builder()
  .debug(true)
  .fallbackVariant(new Variant("off"))
  .fetchTimeoutMillis(500)
  .build()
```

## Fetch Variants for a User

After initializing anÂ `ExperimentClient`, you will need to fetch variants for your user. First, build yourÂ `ExperimentUser`Â object using theÂ `Builder`, then call your client'sÂ `fetch`Â method with the user.\
BecauseÂ `fetch`Â is asynchronous, flags may not be available immediately. You may use the completion argument to wait for the client to completeÂ `fetch`Â before looking up the variants.

Calling fetch sets the user within the client such that subsequent calls toÂ `fetch`Â will reuse the current user if none is set. On success, fetch stores the variants in the client's user defaults for persistent local lookup.

```swift
// Fetch variants for your user
let user = ExperimentUser.Builder()
    .userId("user@company.com")
    .deviceId("abcezas123")
    .userProperty("premium", value: true)
    .build()
client.fetch(user: ExperimentUser()) { client, error in
  // Fetch complete, handle error or look up variant
}
```

!!!note "User identity"
    
    The user must contain a Device ID and/or User ID, and those values must be the same as the values you pass to Amplitude Analytics. You can choose toÂ [connect to the Amplitude Analytics SDK](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#connecting-to-the-amplitude-analytics-sdk), which provides a convenient way of providing the Device ID and User ID without having to explicitly set them on theÂ `ExperimentUser`

## Look up a Variant

Once variants have been fetched and stored within theÂ `ExperimentClient`, you may look up the variant using the client'sÂ `variant`Â method.

```swift
// Lookup variant for key
let variant = client.variant("YOUR-FLAG-KEY")
if (variant.value == "on") {
  // Flag is on
} else {
  // Flag is off
}
```

### Accessing the Payload

AÂ [`Variant`](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/variants)Â contains an optionalÂ `payload`Â which may be set when configuring your feature flag or experiment. TheÂ `payload`Â in iOS is of typeÂ `Any?`Â meaning you will need to cast the payload to the expected type.

For example, if you have a flagÂ `my-feature-falg`Â with a variantÂ `on`Â which contains a payloadÂ `{"key":"value"}`, you can access the payload and cast to a dictionary, then access the object fields:

```swift
// Lookup variant for key
let variant = client.variant("my-feature-flag")
if (variant.value == "on") {
  if let payload = variant.payload as? [String:String] {
    let value = payload["key"]
  }
}
```

### Local Storage

Client-side Experiment SDKs persist the most recentlyÂ `fetch`ed variants for your user (usesÂ `UserDefaults`Â for persistence). If variants have not been fetched, or the variant to look up has not been assigned to the user, then the client will fall back to various defaults.

### Fallbacks

The experiment client uses three types of fallbacks: explicit, initial variants, and the default fallback variant. Explicit fallbacks are passed into the client'sÂ `variant(String, Variant)`Â function, whereas initial variants and the default fallback variant fallbacks are configured in the client'sÂ `ExperimentConfig`.

### Fallback Priority

The initial source of variants is determined by the configuration'sÂ `Source`. If the lookup cannot find a variant from theÂ `source`Â for the given key the order of fallbacks is as follows:

1. Explicit fallback (must be non-null)
2. `initialVariants`Â (or the local storage ifÂ `source`Â is set to initial variants)
3. `fallbackVariant`Â (defaults to anÂ [empty variant](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/variants))

## Track Exposures

!!!note "Configuration required"

    You must configure the experiment SDK in order to enable exposure tracking; either through anÂ [integration with the Amplitude Analytics SDK](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/ios-sdk#amplitude-analytics-sdk-integration)Â or by implementing a customÂ `ExposureTrackingProvider`. For more information about setting up exposure tracking, please read ourÂ [detailed documentation on exposure tracking](https://developers.experiment.amplitude.com/docs/exposure-tracking).

#### Automatic Exposure Tracking

Automatic exposure tracking, which is enabled by default, tracks an exposure event when a variant is access from the experiment SDK via theÂ `variant()`Â method. Subsequent variant accesses do not trigger an exposure event unless the flag's variant has changed since the last exposure was tracked within the same session.

```swift
Experiment.initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics(apiKey: "your-experiment-key")
experiment.fetch(user: nil, completion: { _, _ in
  // receives {"my-experiment":{"value":"treatment"}}
    experiment.variant('my-experiment'); // Exposure event tracked
    experiment.variant('my-experiment'); // Exposure event not tracked
});
```

#### Explicit Exposure Tracking

Automatic exposure tracking may be turned off via theÂ `automaticExposureTracking`Â configuration option if you wish to be explicit about when exposure events are tracked. Setting this configuration option to false works best in tandem with the newÂ `exposure()`Â function on the experiment client. TheÂ `exposure()`Â function will track an exposure event through the exposure tracking provider using the available variant in the SDK's variant cache for the provided flag/experiment key.

```swift
let config = ExperimentConfigBuilder()
  .automaticExposureTracking(false)
  .build()
Experiment.initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics(apiKey: "your-experiment-key", config: config)

// Exposure event not tracked
const variant = experiment.variant('my-experiment');

// Exposure event tracked
experiment.exposure('my-experiment');
```

## Amplitude Analytics SDK Integration

Integrating Amplitude Analytics and Experiment SDKs in your app is as easy and provides you with a number of benefits to ensure a correct implementation of Amplitude Experiment:

- User Identity Management
  - Changes to User ID, Device ID, and User Properties in the Analytics SDK are shared with the Experiment SDK and automatically used whenÂ `fetch()`ing variants.
  - Optionally configure the Experiment SDK to automaticallyÂ `fetch()`Â updated variants whenever the User's identity changes.
- Built-in Exposure Tracking
  - Automatically track exposure events whenÂ `variant()`Â is called to access a variant the Experiment SDK.
  - Explicitly track a user's exposure to a flag's variant through Analytics by callingÂ `exposure()`

### Upgrading

Integrated analytics and experiment SDKs are supported in the following platforms and SDK versions:

| Analytics SDK Version | Experiment SDK Version |
| --- | --- |
| `8.8.0+` | `1.6.0+` |

### Initialization

SDK initialization can happen in any order, without needing to directly inject the analytics SDK into the experiment configuration. That said, you still need to initialize Amplitude Analytics in order for the integration to work. Simply call theÂ `initializeWithAmplitudeExperiment(...)`Â function in the experiment SDK and your analytics instance will be used automatically when it completes initialization.

```swift
Amplitude.instance().initializeWithApiKey("your-analytics-key");
Experiment.initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics(apiKey: "your-experiment-key")
```

By using this initialization function, theÂ `userProvider`Â andÂ `exposureTrackingProvider`Â are automatically set up to enable automatic identity management and exposure tracking.

#### Configuration

Any standard Experiment SDK configuration may be used when initializing an integrated Experiment client. That said, we recommend not setting any customÂ `userProvider`Â orÂ `exposureTrackingProvider`Â , as those are set up by default to integrate with the analytics SDK. Finally, if you use a custom instance name for your Analytics SDK, you must configure experiment with the same instance name in theÂ `instanceName`Â configuration option.

##### Integration Specific Configuration

| Name | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `automaticFetchOnAmplitudeIdentityChange` | IfÂ `true`Â automatically fetch updated variants for the user whenever the user's identity state changes. | `false` |

### Fetch Variants

An explicit user object should not be passed toÂ `fetch()`Â when using an integrated SDK since all the user information is accessed from the Analytics SDK. In fact, passing explicit user info will actually overwrite the user information provided by analytics which may cause issues with exposures and analysis.

```swift
experiment.fetch(user: nil, completion: nil)
```
