### Use cases

1. **Personalized Onboarding:** You can use data from Amplitude to identify specific user segments based on their behavior, such as those who drop off during onboarding or those who engage extensively. With Apxor, you can create personalized nudges and messages to guide users through onboarding, helping them understand the value of your product and reducing abandonment rates.
2. **Feature Adoption:** When you analyze user behavior in Amplitude, you can identify underused features or features that cause confusion. Apxor enables you to target these users with in-app nudges that provide step-by-step guidance on how to use these features effectively, encouraging greater feature adoption and use.
3. **User Activation:** Use Amplitude data to pinpoint users who haven't reached the desired level of engagement with your product. With Apxor, you can create nudges that encourage users to take specific actions or follow certain paths to achieve activation, thus increasing the likelihood of them becoming long-term users.
