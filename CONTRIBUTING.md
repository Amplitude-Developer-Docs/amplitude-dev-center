### For users
--------

If you are making subtantial updates, read our [style guide](/style-guide.md) and [formatting cheatsheet](formatting-cheatsheet.md) before starting work. When you're ready, open a PR. 

### For Ampliteers 
-----

- To get started with contributing, check out the [Developer Docs Confluence site](https://amplitude.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/1751449830/Developer+Docs). There, you'll find more conceptual content, including style guides and markdown cheatsheets.
- If you're working on a feature that hasn't been announced yet, do your work in the **amp-internal-dev repo**. When you're ready to ship, open a PR against main. Learn more in [Confluence](https://amplitude.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/1778384912/Working+on+Docs+Secretly).
- **This is an open source project**! Before you push, make sure you haven't committed any sensitive information, including test account API keys or other credentials. It's hard to undo this kind of mistake, so if you accidentally push sensitive info, consider it compromised. Check the Developer Docs Confluence site for next steps.
- If you have questions or need any help getting started, reach out in #dev-doc-requests.
