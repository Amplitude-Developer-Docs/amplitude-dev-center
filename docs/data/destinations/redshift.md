title: Redshift Export (Beta)
description: Upload your Amplitude event data to your Redshift account with recurring exports. 
---

Upload your Amplitude event data into your Redshift account. You can set up recurring syncs through the Amplitude UI, as well as manually initiate a sync of your historical data.

## Set up a recurring data export to Redshift

Creating a recurring data export is a simple, three-step process you can handle yourself. Each sync will complete within five to ten minutes, you will be able to monitor the status of each job.

To set up a recurring export of your Amplitude data to Redshift, follow these steps:

!!!note

    You will need admin privileges in Amplitude, as well as a role that allows you to enable resources in Redshift.

1. Navigate to the *Data Destinations* page from the bottom of the left side panel.
2. CLick **View all Destinations**, click the Redshift panel.
3. Under *Export Data to Redshift*, select the data you'd like to export. You can choose *Export events ingested today and moving forward*, *Export all merged Amplitude ID*, or both.
4. Review the Event table and Merge IDs table schemas and click **Next**.
5. In the *Redshift Credentials For Amplitude* section, enter the following information:

     - **User**: The Redshift user account that Amplitude will use to connect to your Redshift instance.
     - **Password**: The password associated with the User.
     - **Database**: The database where the data will be exported to and stored. We recommend dedicating a database for Amplitude data.
     - **Cluster Host Address**: This is the address of the endpoint of the cluster that hosts your database.
     - **Port**: The port of the Cluster Host Address.  This may only contain digits. The default value is 5439.

    !!!warning 

        These credentials are case-sensitive, so keep that in mind.

6. Next to the credentials section, Amplitude dynamically creates the query it will use to create Redshift objects. To copy it to the clipboard, click **Copy**. You can now paste it into the Redshift CLI.
7. Click **Next**. Amplitude will try to upload test data using the credentials you entered. If the upload is successful, click **Finish**.

All future events are automatically sent to Redshift.

From here, Amplitude generates micro-batch files at five-minute intervals and loads them to customer-owned Redshift accounts directly every 10 minutes. You can see the data in your Redshift accounts within 20 minutes after Amplitude receives the events.

## Export historical Amplitude data to Redshift

To export your historical data from Amplitude into Redshift, navigate to the *Backfills* tab, select a date range, and click **Start Backfill**.

This process can take anywhere from a single day to several weeks, depending on your data volume, warehouse size, cluster count, network bandwidth, and number of concurrent historical data exports you currently have, among other factors.

## Redshift Export Format

The **Event** table schema will include the following columns:

| <div class="big-column">Column</div>| Type | Description |

| `Adid` | String | (Android) Google Play Services advertising ID (AdID). Example: AEBE52E7-03EE-455A-B3C4-E57283966239 |
| `amplitude_event_type` | VARCHAR(1677721) | Amplitude specific identifiers based on events Amplitude generates. This is a legacy field so event_type should suffice for all queries  |
| `amplitude_id` | BIGNUMERIC | The original Amplitude ID for the user. Use this field to automatically handle merged users. Example: 2234540891 |

| `event_id` | INT64 | A counter that distinguishes events. Example: 1 |
| `event_properties` | STRING |    |
| `event_time` | TIMESTAMP | Amplitude timestamp (UTC) which is the client_event_time adjusted by the difference between server_received_time and client_upload_time, specifically: event_time = client_event_time + (server_received_time - client_upload_time)   Amplitude uses this timestamp is used to organize events on Amplitude charts. NOTE: If the difference between server_received_time and client_upload_time is less than 60 seconds, the event_time will not be adjusted and will equal the client_event_time. Example: `2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000` |
