???info "Ampli Wrapper versus the Amplitude SDK"
    The [Ampli Wrapper](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/ampli/sdk/) is an autogenerated library based on your pre-defined [tracking plan](https://developers.data.amplitude.com/what-is-a-tracking-plan).
    This is a lightweight wrapper over the Amplitude SDK that provides type-safety, automatic code completion, linting, and schema validation. The generated code replicates the spec in the Tracking Plan and enforces its rules and requirements.
    This guide is about the Ampli SDK. To learn more about the underlying Amplitude SDK, see our [SDK Quickstart Guide](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/sdk-quickstart).
