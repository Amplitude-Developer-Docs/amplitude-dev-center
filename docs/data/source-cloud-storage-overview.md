Import event, user properties, and group properties from your cloud storage sources into Amplitude with a few setup steps. Use cloud storage sources to backfill large amounts of existing data, connect existing data pipelines to Amplitude, and ingest large volumes of data where you need high throughput and latency is less sensitive.

During setup, you configure conversion rules to control how events are instrumented. See the [Converter Configuration Reference](../data/converter-configuration-reference.md) for tips and details.
