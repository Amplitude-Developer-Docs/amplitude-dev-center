The Export API lets you export your project's event data.

## Endpoints

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Server | [https://amplitude.com/api/2/export](https://amplitude.com/api/2/export) |
| EU Residency Server | [https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com/api/2/export](https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com/api/2/export) |

## Considerations

- The specified date range refers to the time the event data was uploaded to Amplitude servers (see server_upload_time). The Export API returns events timestamped in UTC. Data is available to export at a minimum within 2 hours of when the servers received it. For example, data sent between 8 and 9 PM begins loading at 9 PM and is available via the Export API at 11 PM. Note that there is no delay in platform reporting. Only exports are delayed.
- Export API isn't supported for a cross-project view because the view doesnâ€™t own any data. To export all the data in the view, you would need to call the Export API on the underlying projects that actually ingested the data.
- Size limit is 4GB. If the size exceeds 4GB, the request returns a 400 response. In this case, choose a smaller time range to export the data. In cases where an hour's worth of data exceeds 4GB, use the [Amazon S3 export](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044561111-Amazon-S3-Amplitude-Integration).
- To export a whole day, Use T00 to T23. The max time range you can query at once is 365 days.

## Example request

`GET https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

```bash
GET /api/2/export?start=20220101T00&end=20220127T00 HTTP/1.1
Host: amplitude.com
Authorization: Basic {{api-key}}:{{secret-key}}
```

## Query parameters

|Name|Description|
|-----|------------|
|`start`| Required. First hour included in data series, formatted YYYYMMDDTHH. For example, '20220201T05'.|
|`end` |Required. Last hour included in data series, formatted YYYYMMDDTHH For example, '20220201T05'.|

## Response

The response is a zipped archive of JSON files. Depending on data volume, there can be several files per hour. The API returns a 404 response is there is no data for the time range you requested.

!!! note
    Events prior to November 12, 2014 are grouped by day, instead of by the hour.

### Response schema

The response includes one event JSON object per line in each file, with the following schema:

## Status codes

|Code|Message|
|----|---------|
|200|Success|
|400|The file size of the exported data is too large. Shorten the time ranges and try again. The limit size is 4GB.|
|404|No data available for the time range requested.|
|504|The amount of data is large causing a timeout. For large amounts of data, use the [Amazon S3 destination](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044561111-Amazon-S3-Amplitude-Integration).|
