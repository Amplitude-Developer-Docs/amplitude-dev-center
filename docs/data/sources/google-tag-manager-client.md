title: Google Tag Manager Template - Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK
description: Collect data with ease using Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK GTM template - the official client-side Google Tag Manager template for seamless data collection.
---

This is the client-side Google Tag Manager Template for Amplitude Analytics. The tag uses the [Amplitude Marketing Analytics SDK](../../sdks/marketing-analytics-browser/) for data collection. However, due to inherent limitations of GTM, certain features, such as plugins, are not available in this GTM template.

## Workflow

### Container Setup

If you start from zero, you need to setup your conatiner first. This Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK tag template can be found in **Web** target platorm which for use on descktop and mobile web pages.

### Add Templage

Create a new tag template by searching the gallery. Choose Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK and click `add` button.

### Create Tags

Create tags for your amplitude browser SDK tracking. Click the `New` button to create your new tags.

#### Tag Configuration

We provided a list of tag type for amplitude tracking. Some times you are also reqruied to create a Custom HTML tag to do customization, like cross domain tracking or others. In order to access `amplitude` successfully, please make sure that the `init` tag is loaded before this Custome HTML tag, [time sequence](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6238868) might be helpful in this case. Please check [this section](./#access-amplitude-instance) for accessing amplitude instance. Also notice that  We are not recomended to use script loading to init amplitude through Cusom HTML tag.

#### API Key

Copy your amplitude API Key in the API Key field. For EU recidency, please make your API Key is under analytics.eu.amplitude.com. See [this page](https://tagmanager.google.com/?authuser=0#/container/accounts/6053924196/containers/91603214/workspaces/62/tags:~:text=project%20settings.%20See-,this%20page,-for%20more%20information) for more details. 

#### Instance Name

If you want to run more than one Amplitude instance (with different API keys or different initialization options), you can provide an Instance Name here. Make sure that all the Amplitude tags that should reference this instance have the Instance Name configured in the tag settings.

#### Access amplitude instance 

If you have a Custome HTML tag, you might need to acccess `amplitude` instance in your script tag. 

- to access `amplitude` instance with defualt instance name 

```js
// for the underlining marketing-analytics-browser-gtm version greater than v0.5.4
amplitudeGTM.getDeviceId();

// for the underlining marketing-analytics-browser
amplitude.getDeviceId();
```

- to access `amplitude` instance with customized instance name

```js
// for the underlining using marketing-analytics-browser-gtm
amplitudeGTM._iq["yourInstanceName"].getDeviceId();

// for the underlining musing arketing-analytics-browser
amplitude._iq["yourInstanceName"].getDeviceId();
```

#### Tag Types

Please check [here](./) to see all avaliable tag taps in Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK GTM.

note!!!
    `init` tag type are seprate from other api methods. You must to make sure you create a tag for `init` tag type. Otherwise, none of you amplitude tag will be fired.

#### Triggering

All tags fire based on events. Anytime Google Tag Manager registers an event, event triggers are evaluated and tags are fired accordingly. Please check [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/topic/7679108?sjid=4311393792871502449-NA) for avaialbe triggers in GTM. 

note!!!
    Tipically `init` tag is the first thing you need to fire on the page. It's common to fire the `init` tag using `All Pages` or `Initialization - All Pages` triggers. You can also defer the `init` tag until you receive a signal and fire it using customized triggers, such as a consent grant. But notice that all other tags will wait for the `init` tag to fire before they can be sent to Amplitude. 

### Tag Types

#### init

##### EU Data Residency

For EU data residency, you must set up your project inside Amplitude EU and use the API key from Amplitude EU. You can configure the server zone by checking the checkbox **EU Data Residency** under **Tag Configuration** -> **Initialization** of the `init` tag. The initialization section only shows up when tag type is set to init. 

##### Enable attribution tracking

Check this box to enable additional configuration options for attribution. [More details](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/marketing-analytics-browser/#configuration).

#### User ID

If you want, you can initialize the instance with a User ID, if already available. You can also use the setUserId command to initialize the User ID at a later time. Check [here] for more details.

##### Configurations

- `Use default values`, then the initialization is done with the default values.
--8<-- "includes/sdk-ts-browser/shared-configurations.md"

- Select a {{GTM variable}} from the list, which needs to return an object that has the key-value pairs you want to configure the instance with.

- Set configuration manually in the tag itself, by selecting the corresponding option. The following configurations are the available ones with the value type in GTM template.

You don't need to manuelly trigger the `flush` tag type, it will be auto triggered depended on `flushIntervalMillis` and `flushQueueSize` which has been triggered first. If you want to prevent event dropping caused by closing a browser, you can use `sendBeacon` transport instead  or lower down the flushQueueSize and flushIntervalMillis based on your events traffic load to make sure those event not get stucked in the client side.
