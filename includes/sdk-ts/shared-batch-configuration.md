#### Configure batching behavior

To support high performance environments, the SDK sends events in batches. Every event logged by `track` method is queued in memory. Events are flushed in batch in background. You can customize batch behavior with `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis`. By default, the serverUrl will be `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`. For customers who want to send large batches of data at a time, set `useBatch` to true to set setServerUrl to batch event upload api `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`. Both the regular mode and the batch mode use the same events upload threshold and flush time intervals.
