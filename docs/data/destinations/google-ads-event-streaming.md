Amplitude Data's Google Ads integration enables you to stream your Amplitude event data straight to Google Ads with just a few clicks.

## Considerations

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- Amplitude sends custom events using Amplitude event_type as event name.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up event streaming to Google Ads, you need the following:

- A `Google Ads Customer ID`
- A `Google Ads Conversion Action ID`
- A `Google Cloud Service Account`

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Destinations** tab.
2. In the Event Streaming section, click **Google Ads**.
3. Enter a sync name, then click **Create Sync**.

After you create the destination, you must configure the settings.

#### Configure settings

1. On the **Settings** tab, click **Edit**.
2. Enter your **Google Ads Customer ID**.
3. Enter your **Google Ads Conversion Action ID**.
4. Enter your **Google Cloud Service Account**.
5. Configure **Send Events** to send events ingested by Amplitude to Google Ads.
      1. To send events, toggle **Send Events** to **Enabled**.
      2. Expand the **Select and filter events** panel, and select which events to send. Amplitude recommends that you send only the events you need in Google Ads, rather than selecting **All Events**.
6. Save when finished.

#### Enable integration

The final step is enabling the destination. You must enable the destination to start streaming events.

1. Navigate back to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit**.
2. Toggle **Status** from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
3. Save when finished.
