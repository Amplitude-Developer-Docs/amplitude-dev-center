    This integration is in Closed Beta and is in active development. Contact your Amplitude Client Success Manager for support with this integration.Â 

[TheTradeDesk](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us) allows advertisers to access a wide range of digital advertising inventory, including display ads, video ads, mobile ads, native ads, and more. Advertisers can use the platform to target specific audiences based on various parameters such as demographics, interests, browsing behavior, and location. The platform also offers real-time bidding capabilities, allowing advertisers to bid on ad placements in real-time auctions.

## Considerations

- This integration is only available for customers who have paid plans with Amplitude.
- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- You need a paid The Trade Desk plan to enable this integration.
- This integration with The Trade Desk only allows you to map identifiers to The Trade Desk 36-character GUID, Raw device ID in 36-character GUID (iOS IDFA or Android's AAID) or User's Unified ID 2.0 ([detail](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/UnifiedIDs)).
- Users in the Trade Desk's segment has a TTL (Time-To-Live) parameter. Amplitude set 30 days for TTL of our users in cohorts that are sent to the Trade Desk and this parameter will be refreshed for every sync. So, if you have scheduled sync (Daily, Hourly), you do not have to worry that the users in the Trade Desk's segment sent by Amplitude will expire. If you run `One-Time Sync`, the users in the segment of the Trade Desk will expire in 30 days unless it's synced again.

### Use cases

1. **Improved Audience Targeting:** By sending cohorts or segments of users from Amplitude to The Trade Desk, advertisers can refine their audience targeting. For instance, if Amplitude identifies a group of users who have exhibited certain behaviors or engagement patterns (for example, frequent app usage, specific in-app actions), you can send this cohort can to The Trade Desk for more precise ad targeting. This approach helps advertisers reach users who are more likely to convert based on their past behavior.
2. **Personalized Ad Creative:** Amplitude's behavioral insights can help inform the creation of personalized ad creatives. When Amplitude sends cohorts to The Trade Desk, advertisers can tailor their ad content to match the interests and preferences of specific user groups, increasing the likelihood of capturing their attention and driving conversions.
3. **Campaign Optimization:** The behavioral data collected by Amplitude can be used to optimize ongoing advertising campaigns on The Trade Desk. By understanding how different user cohorts respond to various ad creatives, placements, and messaging, advertisers can adjust their campaigns in real-time to maximize performance and ROI.
4. **Retargeting Strategies:** Amplitude can identify users who have shown interest but haven't completed desired actions, such as making a purchase or signing up. By sending these non-converting cohorts to The Trade Desk, advertisers can design retargeting campaigns that re-engage these users with tailored messaging and incentives.
5. **Lookalike Audience Expansion:** Amplitude's cohorts can serve as the basis for creating lookalike audiences on The Trade Desk. These are audiences that share similar characteristics with existing high-value user groups. By utilizing Amplitude's insights, advertisers can identify valuable traits and behaviors to build larger audiences that are likely to be receptive to their ads.
