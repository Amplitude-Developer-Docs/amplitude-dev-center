## Overview

The [Ampli Wrapper](/data/sdks/ampli-overview/#ampli-wrapper) is a generated, strongly typed API for tracking Analytics events based on your Tracking Plan in Amplitude Data. The tracking library exposes a function for every event in your team’s tracking plan. The function’s arguments correspond to the event’s properties.

[Ampli](/data/sdks/ampli-overview) can benefit your app by providing autocompletion for events & properties defined in Data and enforce your event schemas in code to prevent bad instrumentation.
