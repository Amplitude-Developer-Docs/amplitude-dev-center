## Overview

The Ampli Wrapper is a generated, strongly typed API for tracking Analytics events based on your Tracking Plan in Amplitude Data. The tracking library exposes a function for every event in your team’s tracking plan. The function’s arguments correspond to the event’s properties.

Ampli can benefit your app by providing autocompletion for events & properties defined in Data and enforce your event schemas in code to prevent bad instrumentation.
