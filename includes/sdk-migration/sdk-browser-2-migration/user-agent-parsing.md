In Browser 2.0, we remove functionality to parse user agent that populates `event.os_name`, `event.os_version`, `event.device_model`, `event.device_manufacturer` on the client side. This is replaced with user agent server-side parsing which offered by Amplitude ingestion endpoints. These changes might affect your chart analystic related to the user agent properties. However, we provided a [user agent enrichment plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amplitude/plugin-user-agent-enrichment-browser) to enrich the user agent info to keep it backward compatible. Please check [here](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-TypeScript/tree/v1.x/packages/plugin-user-agent-enrichment-browser) for more details.
