title: Send Static List Cohorts to Marketo

!!!alpha

    This integration is currently in Alpha and is in active development. If you have any feedback to improve or have suggestions, please email <integrations@amplitude.com>.Â 

!!!info 

    This page is about the Marketo Static List destination. Unlike the [Marketo](../destinations/marketo-cohort/) destination, this integration automatically exports cohorts as a static list in Marketo.

## Considerations

- Email values are case-sensitive. If you use email addresses to map users between Amplitude and Marketo, the email address must be consistent between both systems.
- Marketo automatically generates Amplitude users that don't already exist in Marketo are generated automatically.

## Setup

### Marketo setup

!!!note

    You need a Marketo Admin for these setup steps.

You need your Marketo Client ID, Client Secret, and REST API Endpoint. For more detailed instructions, visit [Marketo's documentation](https://developers.marketo.com/blog/quick-start-guide-for-marketo-rest-api/).

1. Create a role with "Read-Write Person" and "Read-write Assets" permissions under "Access API"
2. Create an API-only user and associate it with the API role created previously.
3. Go to **Admin > Integration > Launchpoint** to create a new service. Set 'Service' to 'Custom' and select the API Only User you created in the last step.
4. On the service, click **View Details** and copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
5. Go to **Admin > Integration > Web Services** and copy the REST API Endpoint. **Important**: Remove the `\rest` at the end of the endpoint. For example, REST URL: https://my-marketo.mktorest.com. If you don't remove it, the integration doesn't work correctly.

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude Data, navigate to **Destinations**, then find **Marketo Static List - Cohort**.
2. Click **Add another destination**.
3. Enter the name for the connection
4. Paste the Client ID, Client Secret, and REST API endpoint you copied from Marketo.
5. Assign the Amplitude field mapping for email. This must be a unique identifier.
6. Save when finished.

## Send a cohort

To sync your first cohort, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude, open the cohort you want to sync, then click **Sync**.
2. Select **Marketo Static List**, then click **Next**.
3. Choose the account you want to sync to.
4. Choose the folder type and provide the folder/program ID.
5. Choose the sync cadence.
6. When finished, save your work.

It may take a few minutes depending on the size of your cohort to see the correct number of cohort users on Marketo's side.
