Amplitude Data's Webhook integration lets you stream your Amplitude event data to custom webhooks.

## Setup

### Webhook setup

Create a webhook endpoint that can receive HTTP requests. 

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Destinations** then find **Webhook - Event Stream**.
2. Enter a sync name, then click **Create Sync**.
3. Click **Edit**, then:
     - Enter the URL endpoint for the webhook. For example, `https://mycompany.com/webhook`.
     - Customize the HTTP headers to send with the event. There are two preset headers that are always sent, and you can specify up to 5 more. For example, specifying `Authorization` â†’ `Bearer XXXXXX` for one of the headers sets the `Authorization: Bearer XXXXX` header on the outgoing HTTP requests.
     - Customize the event payload using FreeMarker Templating Language. You also have the option to forward the original JSON export event format as-is without any transformation. See [the FreeMarker Templating Language](#freemarker-templating-language) section for more help and examples.
4. Use the *Send events* filter to select the events you want to send. You can send all events, but Amplitude recommends choosing the most important ones.
5. When finished, enable the destination and save.

## FreeMarker Templating Language

Amplitude uses [Apache FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/ "https://freemarker.apache.org/") templates to customize your event payloads that you send to webhook.

- Customers can use the FreeMarker Templating Language (FTL) to transform [Amplitude's JSON export event format](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/export-api/ "https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/export-api/") into any other JSON schema expected by the Webhook destination.
- FreeMarker is a free, open source templating engine with a large community.

!!!tip "More FreeMarker help"

    See the FreeMarker [guide to creating templates](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui.html) for more help. 

### Example template

```text
{
      <#if input.user_id??>
      "external_id" : "${input.user_id}",
      </#if>
      "name" : "${input.event_type}",
      "time" : "${input.event_time}",
      "properties" : {
            "email" : "${input.user_properties.email!}
      }
}
```

Using this template results in sending this JSON payload to the Webhook endpoint:

```json
{
    "external_id" : "some user id",
    "name" : "click event",
    "time" : "2022-10-24 20:07:32.123",
    "properties" : {
            "email" : "some@email.com"
    }
}
```

- FreeMarker replaces the `${ ... }` constructs with the actual value of the expression inside the curly braces.
- `input` is a reserved variable that refers to the event as an object, as defined [here](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/export-api/).
- `input.event_type` refers to the `event_type` field of the event.
- `input.user_properties` refers to the user properties dictionary
- `input.user_properties.email` refers to the `email` field in user properties
- the `if` directive is used to check wether the `input.user_id` exists. if it doesn't, the `external_id` field is omitted from the output
- the `!` mark in the expression after `input.user_properties.email` can be used to provide a default value if there is no such field in the `input`. If you don't add a default value, the output contains an empty string instead.
