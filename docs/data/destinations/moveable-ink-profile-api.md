[Movable Ink](https://movableink.com/) activates any data into personalized content in any customer engagement and is a powerful extension to the technologies that marketers use today. The platform connects to all relevant data, no matter where it lives, updates based upon a recipient's most recent interactions, and is autogenerated by the platform.

This integration lets you automatically generate and target content based on any of the data available via Amplitude's User Profile API. The [User Profile API](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/user-profile-api/?h=user+profil) serves Amplitude user profiles, which include user properties, computed user properties, a list of cohort IDs of cohorts that the user is in, and recommendations.
