## Delivery metrics

The events delivered, not delivered, and delivery rate metrics for this destination are an estimate based on a sample of events sent to the Google Analytics 4 validation endpoint. Up to the first 100 events (and 100 identifies, if "Send Users" is enabled) are sent every 10 minutes, and scaled based on the total number of events sent. Latency metrics are still computed from all events.
