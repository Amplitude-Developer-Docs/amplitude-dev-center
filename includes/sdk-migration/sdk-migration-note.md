This section provides a comparison between different version of SDKs. This overview provides key insights for developers, identifying areas that have significant changes and need careful consideration.

!!!note

    While there are multiple versions of our SDK available, please use the latest version of the SDKs rather than maintenance SDKs. Maintenance versions only provide support and will eventually be deprecated. The [latest SDK](../../sdk-architecture/) adopts an aligned architecture, with no extra dependencies, and offers enhanced stability for optimal performance.
