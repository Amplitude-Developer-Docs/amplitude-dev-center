!!!note "Send Amplitude data to Braze"

    This integration brings Braze data into Amplitude. To send events and cohorts to Braze, see these article: 

    - [Send Cohorts to Braze](/../data/destinations/braze-cohort)
    - [Braze Event Streaming](/../data/destinations/braze) 

Import Braze events into Amplitude using Braze Currents. Currents is included with certain Braze packages, contact your Braze Customer Success Manager or support@braze.com if you want access. Note that any events you send from Braze to Amplitude count toward your Amplitude event volume quota.

See [Amplitude for Currents](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_for_currents/) in the Braze documentation to set up and use this integration.
