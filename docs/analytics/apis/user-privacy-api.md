title: User Privacy API
description: The User Privacy API lets you programmatically submit requests to delete all data for a set of known Amplitude IDs or User IDs.

---

The User Privacy API helps you comply with end-user data deletion requests mandated by global privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
 The API lets you programmatically submit requests to delete all data for a set of known Amplitude IDs or User IDs.

## Endpoints

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Server | [https://amplitude.com/api/2/deletions/users](https://amplitude.com/api/2/deletions/users) |
| EU Residency Server | [https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com/api/2/deletions/users](https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com/api/2/deletions/users) |

## Considerations

Keep these considerations in mind when using the User Privacy API.

- When you make a deletion request, Amplitude emails all account admins with the deletion details.
- Amplitude deletes all events and user properties added up until the time that job runs for each Amplitude ID in a deletion job.
- Running a deletion job for a user doesn't block new events for that user. Amplitude accepts new events from a deleted user.
- If Amplitude receives events for a deleted user, then it counts the deleted user as a new user.
 Because deletion removes all user data from Amplitude servers, Amplitude doesn't recognize the new user as the deleted user.
- To reduce resource impact and ensure high availability, Amplitude batches requests for deletions. Batch jobs are scheduled for 10-13 days after the date of the batch's first request.
 In line with GDPR article 12.3 and 17, Amplitude processes deletion requests without undue delay, within 30 days after receiving the request.
 The actual timeline for deletion depends on the complexity and number of requests Amplitude receives.
 If your data volume is large (>1BB/month), then Amplitude may need to reduce your frequency of deletion scheduling.
- You can revoke requests in the batch until three (3) days before the day the job scheduled run date. During the three (3) day period, you can't edit the batch.
 Amplitude adds deletion requests made during this time to a new batch.
- After the three (3) day period, the request's status changes to `submitted`. You can't stop the job at this point.
 The deletion process removes all data associated with the user from all Amplitude's systems, including associated recovery and back-up systems.
 After the job completes, its status changes to `done`.

!!! warning
    Using this API doesn't prevent future user tracking for the deleted users. To learn about how to stop tracking users in your application, see the `setOptOut()` method in the SDKs.

## Limits

The endpoint `/api/2/deletions/users` has a rate limit of 1 HTTP request per second. Each HTTP request can contain up to 100 `amplitude_ids` or `user_ids`.
 You can make up to 100 deletion requests per second if you batch 100 users in each request.

## Delete users

`POST /deletions/users`

Add a user for deletion using a JSON body. Specify up to 100 users at a time. You can use mix of Amplitude IDs and User IDs.

### JSON body parameter

The body parameter is required. It's the deletion request object listing the `user_ids` and `amplitude_ids` for the users to delete.

| <div class="big-column">Name</div> | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `amplitude_ids` | Amplitude IDs for the users to delete. |
| `user_ids` | User IDs for the users to delete. |
| `requester` | The internal user who requested the deletion. This is useful for auditing. |
| `ignore_invalid_id` | When `true`, the job ignores invalid user IDs. Invalid user IDs are users that don't exist in the project. |
| `delete_from_org` | Delete user from the entire org instead of a single project. This feature is available in orgs with the Portfolio feature enabled. Requests must be by `user_ids`. Values can be either `True` or `False`. Defaults to `False`. |
| `include_mapped_user_ids` | When `true`, each valid `user_id` from `user_ids` is included in a corresponding object of `amplitude_ids` response array. |

## Get deletion jobs

`/api/2/deletions/users?start_day=YYYY-MM-DD&end_day=YYYY-MM-DD`

Retrieves a list of deletion jobs scheduled in a time range. The time range should include the date you made the request on plus 30 days. For example, you made a deletion request on August 1st, 2018.
 Your deletion request should have `start_day = 2018-08-01` and `end_day = 2018-08-31`.

If the request returns no values, then no jobs are scheduled for that time range. Note: The largest permitted time range is six months.
