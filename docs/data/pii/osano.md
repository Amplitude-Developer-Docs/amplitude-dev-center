title: Manage Personal Data with Osano
description: Connect Osano and Amplitude to automatically classify personal data stored in Amplitude.
---

[Osano](https://www.osano.com/) is an easy-to-use data privacy platform that helps you keep your website compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. Osano monitors all the vendors you share data with so you don't have to.

Osano connects to Amplitude via a one-click integration. Osano then discovers and automatically classifies the personal data stored in Amplitude. After discovery and classification are finished, you can include Amplitude in searches related to subject rights requests.
