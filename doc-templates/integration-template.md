- You must do X, Y, and Z to sync user data between YOUR APP and Amplitude. 

## Setup

### Prerequisites

If there are any prerequisites before you begin setup in Amplitude or your app, list them here. For example: if a user must map certain fields or sanitize data in a particular way, note it here. If there are no prereqs, delete this section.

### Amplitude setup

<!-- Choose the setup steps that are most appropriate for your integration. Make changes where needed. Delete comments and unused instruction blocks. If neither of the choices are appropriate, write your own -->

<!-- Source Instructions: If you just need an Amplitude Key-->

Before you begin, you need your Amplitude project API key. 

There are no other setup steps in Amplitude.

<!-- End Source Instructions: Amplitude Key only-->

<!-- Destination Instructions-->

1. In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Destinations**, then find **Your App Name**.
2. Add more steps as needed. 

<!-- End Destination Instructions-->


### YOUR APP setup

List the setup steps in your app. If your app setup needs to be done before Amplitude setup, swap the order of these sections.
