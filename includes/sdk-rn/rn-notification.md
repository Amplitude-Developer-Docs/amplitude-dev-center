!!!info "React Native Support"
    Since [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) does not provide stable release versioning, ensuring backward compatibility is challenging, especially as React-Native itself isn't backward compatible and might introduce breaking changes across different versions. You can check [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#compatibility) for more details. Therefore, we only support the latest version of React-Native until it is out of beta. Once React-Native reaches GA, we will improve our support and strive for backward compatibility.
