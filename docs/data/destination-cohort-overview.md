Send Amplitude cohorts to the other tools in your stack in just a few clicks, using no-code cohort integrations (also called destinations).

Learn more about behavioral cohorts in the [Help Center](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/231881448).

## Considerations

Keep these general considerations in mind when working with cohort destinations.

- You must have [Amplitude Audiences](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028552471) to send cohorts via these integrations.
- Some destinations support datacenters outside of the US. For more info, refer to the documentation for the specific destination you want to use. 
- Hourly sync cohorts have a maximum of 1 million users.
- Daily sync cohorts have a maximum of 10 million users.

Note that individual destinations may have their own specific considerations, so be sure to read their documentation thoroughly.
