By tracking events and users via mParticle's API and libraries, you can send your product's data to all your analytics platforms, with minimal instrumentation.Â They offer support for most platforms, including Android, iOS, Unity, JavaScript, and more.

After mParticle sends the data to Amplitude's servers, it's quickly processed and displayed in the Amplitude platform for analysis.
