Use the Group Identify API to set or update the properties of particular groups. Keep these considerations in mind:

- Updates affect only future events, and don't update historical events.
- You can track up to 5 unique group types and 10 total groups.

The `groupIdentify` method accepts a group type string parameter and group name object parameter, and an Identify object that's applied to the group.
