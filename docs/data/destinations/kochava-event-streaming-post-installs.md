!!!note "Choose the correct Amplitude Kochava streaming integrations"

    This documentation serves as your guide to handling events that occur after users install your app. These events, often referred to as "custom events," encompass user interactions, purchases, and various other activities that happen within your app post-installation. The primary aim of this documentation is to lead you through the step-by-step process of setting up post-install events and establishing a crucial connection between user identities and their corresponding actions.

    We've developed two distinct integrations, each covered in a separate document â€“ "Kochava (Post-Installs) Event streaming" and "Kochava (Installs) events streaming." This division stems from the requirements of Kochava's IdentityLinkTM feature. IdentityLink calls play a critical role in connecting user identities with their actions. To ensure precise connections, these IdentityLink calls need to occur either concurrently with or after the installation or event data. In other words, the data about the user's identity and the action they performed needs to be available before or at the same time as the IdentityLink call is made. This ensures that the linkage is correctly established and reported.

    Within this documentation, "Kochava (Post-Installs)" focuses on events unfolding after app installations. Here, the "Send User" feature comes into play, establishing essential links between identities and actions. On the other hand, "Kochava (Installs) events streaming" centers around initial app installations. This segment lacks the "Send User" feature, aligning with the prerequisite of timely install data for successful IdentityLink integration.

## Considerations

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- You need a Kochava account to enable this integration.
- Amplitude has two destinations for **Kochava (Install)** and **Kochava (Post Install)**.
  - We support only the identity (user-attributes) forwarding to Kochava in **Kochava (Post Install)**.
- Amplitude uses the **IdentityLink** API of Kochava to send user-attributes and this will link the user-level data with the device ID. The user attributes sent by Amplitude will not be tied if the Install event with the same device ID was not received at Kochava before.
- **Send User Feature:** This feature, "Send User," is available in the destination for Post Install Events. It helps you send the IdentityLink data along with the other event data. This ensures that Kochava knows who the user is and can connect their actions to them.
- Relevant limits for Kochava events are:
    - Kochava does not impose any hard limits on quantity or velocity; however, requests sent too quickly will return 429 responses. Amplitude will handle these automatically. 
    - The requests must be smaller than 2MB.
