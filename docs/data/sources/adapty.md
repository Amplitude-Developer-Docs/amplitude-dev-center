## Considerations

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.

## Setup

This guide is complementary to Adaptyâ€™s instructions. Visit the [Adapty documentation](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/amplitude) for more.

### Amplitude setup

Copy your project's API key. There are no other setup steps in Amplitude. [Find your project API key](../../analytics/find-api-credentials.md).

### Adapty setup

1. Log into your Adapty dashboard.
2. Navigate to Integrations then click on Amplitude and set the API credentials copied over from Amplitude.
3. SDK configuration - Use Adapty.updateProfile() method to set amplitudeDeviceId or amplitudeUserId. If not set, Adapty uses your user ID (customerUserId) or if it's null Adapty ID. Make sure that the user id you use to send data to Amplitude from your app is the same you send to Adapty.
