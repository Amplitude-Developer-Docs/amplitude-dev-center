### Flush

The Ampli wrapper queues events and sends them on an interval based on the configuration.

Call `flush()` to immediately send any pending events.

The `flush()` method returns a promise that can be used to ensure all pending events have been sent before continuing.
This can be useful to call prior to application exit.
