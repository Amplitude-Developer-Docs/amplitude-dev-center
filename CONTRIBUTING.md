# Contributing to Amplitude Developer docs

We welcome contributions from partners and users.

## Getting started

### For Partners
----

More information is coming soon!

### For users
--------

If you are making substantial updates, read our [style guide](/style-guide.md) and [formatting cheatsheet](formatting-cheatsheet.md) before starting work. When you're ready, open a PR.

### For Ampliteers
-----

- To get started with contributing, check out the [Developer Docs Confluence site](https://amplitude.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/1751449830/Developer+Docs). There, you'll find more conceptual content and important information about contributing. 
- If you're working on a feature that hasn't been announced yet, do your work in the **amp-internal-dev repo**. When you're ready to ship, open a PR against main. Learn more in [Confluence](https://amplitude.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PT/pages/1778384912/Working+on+Docs+Secretly).
- **This is an open source project**! Before you push, make sure you haven't committed any sensitive information, including test account API keys or other credentials. It's hard to undo this kind of mistake, so if you accidentally push sensitive info, consider it compromised. Check the Developer Docs Confluence site for next steps.
- If you have questions or need any help getting started, reach out in #dev-doc-requests.
- Use a doc template to get started fast: 
  - [SDK template](doc-templates/sdk-template.md)
  - [Integration template](doc-templates/integration-template.md)
  - [API template](doc-templates/api-template.md)

## How long will it take to get your PR merged?

It depends. We have a small documentation team. Someone will acknowledge your PR within a week and can give you a better idea of how long it will take to get merged.
