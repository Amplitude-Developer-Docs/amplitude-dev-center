The Ampli Wrapper exposes a convenient, strongly-typed API that matches the definitions in your Tracking Plan. The tracking library generated by `ampli pull` is used to track and validate event sent to Amplitude Data. The tracking library is generated on-the-fly to match your tracking plan precisely. This means that instead of tracking events like this:

```java
JSONObject props = new JSONObject();
props.put("name", "Moto 360");

OldLibrary.trackEvent(
  "Product Viewed",
  props
);
```

You track them like this:

```java
ampli.productViewed(
  name = "Moto 360"
)
```

No more typos, forgotten properties, and boilerplate code. The Ampli Tracking Library is like auto-complete for your analytics.
