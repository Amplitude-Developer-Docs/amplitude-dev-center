    This integration is in open beta, and is still in active development. If you have any feedback to help improve the Enterpret Destination and or its documentation, [contact the Enterpret support team](mailto:support@enterpret.com).

Enterpret analyzes your customer feedback across different sources, such as support conversations, App Store reviews, social media posts and automatically finds insights in it using machine learning. [Enterpret's](https://www.enterpret.com/) integration with Amplitude allows you to marry your quantitative data with the qualitative data, and helps you answer better the "Why" behind the "What".
