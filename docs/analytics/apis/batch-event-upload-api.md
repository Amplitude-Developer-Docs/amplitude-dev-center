The Batch Event Upload API lets you upload large amounts of event data.

The event JSON format follows the [HTTP API format](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/http-api-v2), and has the same requirements.

## Endpoints

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Server | [https://api2.amplitude.com/batch](https://api2.amplitude.com/batch) |
| EU Residency Server | [https://api.eu.amplitude.com/batch](https://api.eu.amplitude.com/batch) |

## Considerations

- After a request is accepted, the events in the batch are queryable within 15 minutes.
- The JSON serialized payload must not exceed 20MB in size.
- To prevent instrumentation issues, device IDs and user IDs must be strings with a length of 5 characters or more. If an event has a device or user ID that's too short, the ID value is dropped from the event. If an event doesn't have a user or device ID, it may cause the API to reject the upload with a 400 error. You can change the minimum ID length using the `options` property.
- Each API key can send up to 1000 events per second for any individual device ID or user ID. If you exceed that rate, the API rejects the upload, and gives a 429 response. Check the response summary for more information.

## Batch event upload

Use this request to bulk upload events to Amplitude.

If you have used the HTTP API before, note that there are two minor but important differences in your POST request to `/batch`.

- Content-type must be `application/json`.
- The key for the `events` payload is `events` plural, not `event` singular.

A dictionary of key-value pairs that represent properties sent along with the event. You can store property values in an array. Date values are transformed into string values. Object depth may not exceed 40 layers.                                                                                |
|   `user_properties`   |                        Optional. Object. A dictionary of key-value pairs that represent data tied to the user. You can store property values in an array. Date values are transformed into string values. In addition, user property operations (`$set`,` $setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$unset`) are supported when `event_type` is `$identify`. Object depth may not exceed 40 layers.                         |
|       `groups`        |                        Optional. Object. This feature is available only to customers who have purchased the Accounts add-on. This field adds a dictionary of key-value pairs that represent groups of users to the event as an event-level group. Note: You can only track up to 5 unique group types and 10 total groups. Any groups past that threshold aren't tracked.                         |
|  `group_properties`   | Optional. Object. This feature is available only to customers who have purchased the Accounts add-on. When "event_type" is `$groupidentify`, the field is a dictionary of key-value pairs that represent properties tied to the groups listed in the "groups" field. The field is ignored for other event types. Group property operations (`$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$unset`) are also supported. |
|`$skip_user_properties_sync`|Optional. Boolean. When `true` user properties aren't synced. Defaults to `false`. See [Skip user properties sync](../data-backfill-guide.md#skip-user-properties-sync) for more information.|
|     `app_version`     |                                                                                                                                                                            Optional.

The start time of the session in milliseconds since epoch (Unix Timestamp), necessary if you want to associate events with a particular system. A `session_id` of -1 is the same as no `session_id` specified.                                                                                             |

Amplitude deduplicates subsequent events sent with an `insert_id` that has been seen within the past 7 days. Amplitiude recommends generating a UUID or using some combination of `device_id`, `user_id`, `event_type`, `event_id`, and time.                                                               |

#### Code 429 explained

When a request is rejected with a 429 status, it means that a device or user in that request was throttled. Details about which can be found in the error response data. Logging the response lets you investigate which users or devices were the cause of throttling.

Because `device_id` and `user_id` are the attributes that determine throttling, partitioning work on one of these attributes will help isolate throttling to a specific partition of work. This way partitions which aren't being throttled can still make progress while the throttled partitions are blocked by throttling.

##### EPDS and EPUS

Amplitude measures the rate of events for each deviceid and each userID for a project, and refer to those rates as *events per device second* (**EPDS**) and *events per user second* (**EPUS**) respectively. These values are both averaged over a period of 30 seconds.

For example, to reach an EPDS limit of 1000 requires that a device sends 30,000 events in a 30-second period for the device to be throttled and receive HTTP status 429.

In general, your app shouldn't measure EPDS or EPUS itself. Send requests to Amplitude as fast as possible. When you receive a 429, wait for a short period (for example, 15 seconds) before trying to send that request again.

##### Daily limit

In addition to the per-second limit, there is daily limit to prevent against spam and abuse. This limit is hard to exceed. Events starts counting toward the daily limit after Amplitude determines that a user/device is spamming the system. After the threshold is reached, a daily limit of 500,000 events uploaded per rolling 24 hours is enforced. The 24 hour rolling period applies in one-hour intervals. The daily limit applies for each deviceID and each `user_id` for a project.

The daily limit is independent of the EPDS/EPUS. After a user or device has hit the 500,000 event daily limit for a particular project, any batches uploaded containing the user or device is rejected. In those cases, the request returns a 429 response with a body indicating "exceeded_daily_quota_users" or "exceeded_daily_quota_devices" with list of deviceIDs and userIDs. Retry the batch when there are less than 500,000 events uploaded for a user or device in the previous 24 hour period.
