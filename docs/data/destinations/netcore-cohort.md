    The Netcore Cloud integration is in open beta and is in active development. If you have any feedback to help improve Netcore Cloud destination or have suggestions for their documentation, please [contact the Netcore Cloud support team](mailto:helpdesk@netcorecloud.com).

[Netcore Cloud](https://netcorecloud.com/) offers a full-stack of marketing technology solutions that help product and growth marketers deliver AI-powered intelligent customer experiences across all touchpoints of the user's journey.

This integration lets you sync cohorts from Amplitude to Netcore Cloud's Customer Engagement (CE) & Experience Platform.
