You can set up recurring syncs of your Amplitude event data to BigQuery through the Amplitude UI,  or manually start a sync of your historical data. This article outlines the process for connecting your Amplitude and BigQuery accounts, and then syncing your data.

!!!note "Other Amplitude + BigQuery Integrations"

    This integration sends Amplitude event data to BigQuery. Amplitude offers another integrations with BigQuery: 

    - [Import data from BigQuery](/data/sources/bigquery)

## Prerequisites

To get started with exporting to BigQuery, you need the following:

- A [BigQuery project with the BigQuery Transfer service enabled](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-transfer/docs/enable-transfer-service).
- A [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) for Amplitude. This lets Amplitude to export your data to your Google Cloud project. Your service account needs these roles enabled:
   - BigQuery User
   - BigQuery Data Editor
   - A [custom role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role) that has the following permissions enabled:
     - `bigquery.transfers.get`
     - `bigquery.transfers.update`
     - `bigquery.datasets.update`

After you've created a service account, generate and download the service account key file and upload it to Amplitude. **Make sure you export Amplitude's account key in JSON format**.

## Set up a recurring data export to BigQuery

Creating a recurring data export is a simple, three-step process. Each sync completes within ten minutes, and all jobs are visible in Amplitude.

To set up a recurring export of your Amplitude data to BigQuery, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Destinations**, then click **View more destinations**.
2. Click **Big Query - Raw Events**.
3. On the **Getting Started** tab, select the data you'd like to export and the export's cadence. You can *Export events ingested today and moving forward*, *Export all merged Amplitude IDs*, or both.
4. Review the schemas for the *Event* table and the *Merge IDs* table and click **Next**.
5. Specify the BigQuery dataset to receive your Amplitude data, and upload the service account key file. This file must be in JSON format.
6. Click **Next**. Amplitude attempts a test upload to test the credentials. If the upload is successful, click **Finish** to complete the BigQuery destination configuration and activation.

All future events or merged users are automatically sent to BigQuery. Amplitude exports files to your BigQuery account every hour.

### Event table schema

The **Event** table schema includes the following columns:

| <div class="big-column">Column</div>| Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Adid` | String | (Android) Google Play Services advertising ID (ADID). Example: AEBE52E7-03EE-455A-B3C4-E57283966239 |
| `amplitude_event_type` | VARCHAR(1677721) | Amplitude specific identifiers based on events Amplitude generates. This is a legacy field so event_type should suffice for all queries  |
| `amplitude_id` | BIGNUMERIC | The original Amplitude ID for the user. Use this field to automatically handle merged users. Example: 2234540891 |
| `app` | INT64 | Project ID found in your project's Settings page. Example: 123456 |
| `city` | STRING | City. Example: “San Francisco” |

| `event_id` | INT64 | A counter that distinguishes events. Example: 1 |
| `event_properties` | STRING |    |
| `event_time` | TIMESTAMP | Amplitude timestamp (UTC) which is the `client_event_time` adjusted by the difference between `server_received_time` and `client_upload_time`, specifically: `event_time` = `client_event_time` + (`server_received_time` - `client_upload_time`)   Amplitude uses this timestamp is used to organize events on Amplitude charts. NOTE: If the difference between server_received_time and client_upload_time is less than 60 seconds, the `event_time` isn't adjusted and equals the `client_event_time`. Example: `2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000` |
| `followed_an_identify` | BOOL | True if there was an identify event between this current SDK event and the last SDK event seen. Example: `True` |

|---|---|---|
| `amplitude_id`| NUMBER(38,0) | The Amplitude ID being merged into a user's original Amplitude ID.  |
| `merge_event_time` |TIMESTAMP | The time of the event a user's new Amplitude ID was associated with their original Amplitude ID.  |
| `merge_server_time` | TIMESTAMP | The server time of the event when a user's new Amplitude ID was associated with their original Amplitude ID. |
| `merged_amplitude_id` | NUMBER(38,0) | The originally assigned Amplitude ID when the user is first created.  |
